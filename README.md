# PersonalExpenseManager

A system that uses messages to build a simple personal expense management application

Most of the financial organizations today provide online banking services for their clients. These
applications often have integrated tools for managing personal expenses through either a web interface or a
mobile application.


The interesting task, however, is to integrate such services of different banks so that you have a single place
(application) to monitor the movement of your funds. Integration of information systems related to
multiple banks can be a very complicated task, however there is a simplified way to solve the same
problem. 

Most of the online banking services send text messages (SMSs) as confirmations to inform clients
about all the operations related to their bank accounts (credit cards).

In this project, i will implement a system that uses these messages to build a simple personal expense management application.
